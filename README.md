# Practical Reverse Engineering Exercise Solutions

This repository contains my personal exercise solutions from [Practical Reverse Engineering](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Practical+Reverse+Engineering%3A+x86%2C+x64%2C+ARM%2C+Windows+Kernel%2C+Reversing+Tools%2C+and+Obfuscation-p-9781118787311). It's a little project Iâ€™m using to practice binary analysis and reverse engineering. My goal is to:

- Practice reverse engineering and disassembly
- Familiarize myself with tools like Ghidra, IDA, and Radare2
- Document my process

Each exercise is presented in its own file with rough notes, explanations and code snippets.

Thanks for checking it out!
